## Spring MVC Film C.R.U.D. Project

### In this project we became more familiar with the different errors that can occur, but most importantly, we learned how difficult it is to create a functioning web app. This project has been a lesson in learning to communicate thoroughly and effectively with the team. This project has taught us not not get caught up on an error or go down a rabbit trail by spending too much time figuring out a roadblock on our own before reaching out to fellow collegues for input. 
### This project has taught us to never anticipate that we can complete a project in a certain amount of time and that we should always assume the worst-case-scenario in order to allow time for unanticipated road blocks and problems.
